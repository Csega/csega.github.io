## Introduction

Hi Everyone! So I just figured out I would like to build an exoskeletion, preferably using an already available open source design. Probably improving it a bit if I can.

## The designs I found so far

Here is the list of designs (with the available references).

1. Alice Open Source Exoskeleton ([2021 edition](https://hackaday.io/project/176681-alice-open-source-exoskeleton-2021-update))
2. The GitHub topic for [exoskeletons](https://github.com/topics/exoskeleton)
3. ReStore, ReWalk (commercial development): an article can be found [here](https://szentvincentrehab.hu/restore-rewalk-exoskeletonok-az-orvostudomanyban/) (in Hungarian)

These need to be explained a bit, get a few good ideas and separate the whole exoskeleton projects from just the code and control. This will happen in the next few chapters.

For the work to start, we need a good [Power Supply](https://www.instructables.com/Build-a-Variable-Lab-Bench-Power-Supply/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email) (why not DIY? :) ).

## Alice Open Source Exoskeleton

There is a website, at which you can ask for codes, CAD-models, drawings etc. It is [here](http://www.indi.global/aliceose). I guess it needs to be a collaboration, they want to know that you won't sell their OpenSource product. Just a thought and if that is the case, I agree with that.

## GitHub Exoskeletons

I list and describe here only the full exoskeleton designs and mention a bit the others (maybe they'll be good for the own design).

1. [RehabiliGait](https://www.adnanjafferjee.com/rehabiligait) ([detailed PDF description](https://www.adnanjafferjee.com/_files/ugd/1e1596_f6cb11e3ed6c41548b829d3b0e0802f6.pdf)). Seems quite complete. With designs, software ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/dstock21/Senior-Design)) and theory.
2. [Robotic hand project](https://github.com/morianrojas/Robotic-Hand-controlled-by-different-interfaces) (not found the drawings yet). Software way seems to be complete.
3. [Lightweight Exoskeleton with Assistive Power (LEAP)](https://github.com/ziteh/LEAP): seems to be a complete work. Need to investigate. There is a [newer repo](https://github.com/ziteh/LEAP-upper-limb), which only contains code.


This is it so far. I intend to continue this research, this is a base for now.

EDIT (2022. July 14.): It is useful to check [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/) for designs as well, e.g. [this](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3675305) seems kind of cool.

EDIT (2022. July 26.): I also found [Printables](https://www.printables.com/), [Free3D](https://free3d.com/), [Howtomechatronics](https://howtomechatronics.com/) (this is more like electronics projects, not 3D models), [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/) (also more like a DIY than models), [3DContentCentral](https://www.3dcontentcentral.com), [All3DP](https://all3dp.com/), a [collection for 3D model sites](https://en.eagle.cool/blog/post/best-websites-to-download-free-3d-model-with-high-quality).
