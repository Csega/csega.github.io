This is my first post, which is the edited example page from Jekyll. So I definitely will try the syntax highlight! :) First, with Python, because I use Python quite often. I am very curious, whether I have to do any more at GitHub or it will work out of the box. 

So here is the Python code snippet, I hope it will work.

{% highlight python %}
def print_hi(name):
  print("Hi, {}".format(name))

print_hi('Tom')
# prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

And some useful pages below.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
